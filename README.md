# ITSC 2024 Reproducibility in Transportation Research: A Hands-on Tutorial

>ðŸ”¥ Here's a great example of how to organize code and data poorly.

You should be grateful I even shared my code. Good luck in getting it to work!

I used Python. Run `simulator.py` to get started.

Here are the results of my simulation:

<img src="figure_fvd.png" align=left width="350" /> <img src="figure_svd.png" width="350" />

## Requirements

Create a new conda environment
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate RR
```

## Run the baseline example

From the command line, invoke the simulator:

```
python simulator.py --run-idm --no-render
```
